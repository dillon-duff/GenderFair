            <p> Here we evaluate the gender composition of two levels of leaders--and employees; Trustees or board
              members;
              highest paid executives and overall composition of employees. We can access this data as the IRS requires
              organizations to report it, however other levels of workers is not provided to public. Note that some
              organizations disclose their non-binary employees.

              Although women make up 73 percent of the U.S. nonprofit workforce, they remain in lower level jobs.
              According to an AAUW study, in organizations with budgets of less than $1M, 56 percent of CEOs are women,
              yet in the 22,000 organizations with budgets over $50 million, 22 percent of chief executives are women.
              However, board/trustee representation is typically more balanced with the average being 48% women.

            <p> INSERT CHANGES HERE OR ANYWHERE Equal Pay is a workplace issue that women care most about--according to research that ABX performed for
              Gender Fair on 2,500 Americans. The overall pay gap in the US remains 83 cents for white women, 64 cents
              for black women and or 49 for Bangladeshi women. Overall, the pay gap increases in the do-gooding sector:
              The National Council of Nonprofits reports, “Females on average earn around 24.8% less than males”. The
              gap extends to top jobs: women CEOs at organizations with annual budgets of less than $1 million
              experience
              median pay gaps of between 6 percent and 13 percent relative to male CEOs. At larger nonprofits, the gap
              is
              larger: female CEOs face a median 18 percent pay gap at the nonprofits with the largest budgets. (AAUW) As
              well as revealing gender pay gaps, our ratings also show the ratio between average pay and top salary,
              especially germane since 20 percent of employees struggle from paycheck to paycheck.

          <p>The United States encompasses a diversity of cultures and ethnicities. However, that richness is not
            typically represented in this sector. Approximately 75% of the nonprofit workforce is white; and the
            Urban Institute reports that all-white boards govern 16 percent of nonprofits that primarily focus on
            serving people of color. For profit companies with over 100 employees must submit intersectional EEO1
            data to the government-- and 30% of companies now release that data to the public. However, nonprofit
            organizations are not required to report on workforce diversity, although a petition is now circulating
            to the IRS to change that. A small percentage of nonprofits voluntarily report this information to the
            organization Candid, and we relied on this reporting for our ratings. If a nonprofit did not share
            demographic data with Candid, their score dropped by 10 points.
